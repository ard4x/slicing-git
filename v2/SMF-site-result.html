						<b>High extroversion</b><br/>
						You are an optimistic and easy going person. Your sociability is definitely your strong point, by which you attract attention of others. You like being in company of other people and long solitude is an ordeal for you. Interesting meetings and acquaintances, communicating with different people and new impressions are the breath of your life. You usually meet new people, communicate, act easily. Opinion of others is very important to you. You often try to understand how people perceive you.

						<b>High lability</b><br/>
						You are a bright, emotional and lively person. You fall in the category of those people who are said to have boiling-over energy. Your actions are very often spur-of-the moment, according to your mood, which is quite changeable. In some situations you can lose self-control and act rashly, which shows you not to your advantage in the eyes of the others. In such cases it’s your ease that saves the situation, sometimes it helps to mend relations, achieve reconciliation and avoid irremediable repercussions.

Much more difficult is to keep in touch, to maintain what was achieved at first meeting, get to more serious, long-term relationship. Most often you part with people as easily as you make acquaintance. That’s why others get the impression of you as a lightweight and inconstant.
