            <h1 class="shiny">TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
            <p>Before using our service (offered by Traffic-Market.com), please read these terms of service.</p>
            <p>You have to accept the terms below, if you want to create an account:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    We reserve the right to deny service to any individual or URL at our discretion and at any time. If the service is
                    denied after the campaign has been started, a pro-rata refund will be provided.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We reserve the right to request additional documentation to confirm Account Holder details (the name, address,
                    date of birth and other information to confirm the identity of Account Holder).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Please do not write us about suspected inaccurate counts if you are using a third party JavaScript counter, as our
                    count is final. If at any time you feel that the count is not correct, just cancel your order and request a refund of your
                    remaining balance. Server logs are the only reliable method of keeping statistics. Statistics, data and other
                    information from third party counters can be inaccurate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We are not responsible for the network outages beyond our servers that may disturb us from delivering visitors to
                    your URL (for example, errors on your site, downtime of your server or overuse of your bandwidth cap). Please
                    contact your network provider to make sure that your hosting account is sufficient for the traffic amount you want.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We are not responsible for slow server bandwidth or determination of the server bandwidth capabilities of customer
                    sites.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We are responsible for incorrect URLs, and it is client who should check all the campaign URLs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do not redirect our traffic to any URL that we did not approve. If your site has a virus, spy-ware, pop-up or an auto
                    loader of anything, your account will be frozen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We do not allow torrent sites to use the service.
                    We reserve the right at any time in our sole discretion to change these terms of service. We will notify you 3 days prior to
                    any changes taking effect. You should signify your acceptance of changes, if you want to continue to use our service.
                </li>
